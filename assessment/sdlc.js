// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "They run an analysis to check the feasibility of the development of a product and to understand and get all knowledge for the product"
const Design = "this is the stage where the software developers define the technical details of the product and design the webpage. this can inculde sketches, system interfaces, and prototypes"
const Implementation = "the time during which a project is constructed or implemented which includes testing inspections, adjustments and corrections"
const TestingIntegration = " to perform system integration testing of the developed system. is a test to ensure that the developed systems meet all the technical requirments"
const Maintain = "where the software is monitored so it can continue to fuction like it was designed to do and if any upgrades or repaints that need to be done can be performed"
